# VTOL Flight Path Optimizer

The VTOL Flight Path Optimizer is a Streamlit-based web app that allows users to simulate and plan low-altitude urban air routes. Designed with mobile users in mind, the app currently uses latitude and longitude input, but will soon support drag-and-drop route planning and address entry.

## Features

- Latitude and longitude-based route planning (address input and drag-and-drop coming soon)
- Cruise altitude selection
- Real-time path visualization
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Regulatory-aware routing (coming soon)

## FAA Dataset Integration

We are integrating FAA regulatory data to help users avoid **no-fly zones and restricted airspace**.
